\title{numGen: A package for generating number series items.}
\description{
The numGen package provides 14 item models for generating number series items.
}
\section{Item model 1}{

This number series generates simple linear sequences with a magnitude of up to 5000.\cr
\code{\link{nmOne}}
}

\section{Item model 2}{

This number series generate sequences consist of elements belonging to two homogeneous groups with equal number of elements.\cr
\code{\link{nmTwo}}
}

\section{Item model 3}{

This function allows you to select one of the four arithmetic operators following a sequence succession rule.\cr
\code{\link{nmThree}}
}

\section{Item model 4}{

The core feature of sequences is the numeric representation of the object count.  The sequences consist of homogeneous groups of letters followed by a number representing the amount of the group elements.\cr
\code{\link{nmFour}}
}

\section{Item model 5}{

This create items that relates to comprehension of abstract object representation (Item model 5) and Identification of co-occurring relationships between elements (Item model 4).\cr
\code{\link{nmFive}}
}

\section{Item model 6}{

Generate items with two sequences combined into one number series.\cr
\code{\link{nmSix}}
}

\section{Item model 7}{

This model uses the addition and substraction (Arithmetic) operator, Linear pattern and Progressive coefficient to create the number series.\cr
\code{\link{nmSeven}}
}

\section{Item model 8}{

This function creates number series that is a combination of Arithmetic, Linear and Complex coefficient. \cr
First logic of complex coefficient = i*x+y.\cr
Second logic of complex coefficient = (i+x)*y.\cr
 \code{\link{nmEight}}
}

\section{Item model 9}{

This is based on the categorical / pattern recognition rule. Neighbouring pairs or triads of objects are related, includes arithmetic operations. \cr
\code{\link{nmNine}}
}

\section{Item model 10}{

This function creates Fibonacci sequences. The maximum number to be generated is 15 items.\cr
\code{\link{nmTen}}
}

\section{Item model 11}{

The number series is a combination of Arithmetic, linear sequence and progressive coefficient. \cr
First logic is combining sequences x y x y x y x y = one simple (cannot be controlled), one progressive. \cr
Second logic is combining sequences x y x y x y x y = two progressive. \cr
 \code{\link{nmEleven}}
}

\section{Item model 12}{

Neighbouring objects + 2-sequence coefficient. \cr
This function creates number series that is a combination of Neighbouring objects + 2-sequence coefficient. \cr
Multiplication and Division is removed since the calculated value is too big. \cr
 \code{\link{nmTwelve}}
}

\section{Item model 13}{

This function creates number series that is a irregular combination of sequences a b b a b b a ... \cr
Only the addition and substraction arithmetic operators are used to create the number series items. \cr
 \code{\link{nmThirteen}}
}

\section{Item model 14}{

Combination of sequences and ratios. \cr
\code{\link{nmFourteen}}
}
