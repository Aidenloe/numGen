#' @param rank This is the Rank of the maze.
#' @param satPercent This is the saturation of the coloured nodes.
#' @param score This is the series of connected paths via the black dots.
#' @param nodePosition You need to calculate the nodePosition.
#' @description The ability function returns the weighted score of the individual given his raw score (i.e. the number of black dotes collected).
#' @details The ability function is calculated following the paper in XXXX.
